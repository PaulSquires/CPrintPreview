# CPrintPreview
Print Preview Class for Windows (FreeBASIC programming lanhuage)


Features:

Even though CPrintPreview is small and lightweight, it does provide several great features that rival commercial products, such as:
- All source code. No need for DLL for ActiveX.
- Incredibly fast! You can generate a hundred pages in a fraction of a second.
- Canvas pages are stored in standard memory using EMF (Enhanced Memory Files).
- You can design pages freely allowing you to jump between pages as you require rather than having to start at the first page and create pages sequentially.
- High DPI aware.
- The preview window can be used standalone and not tied to a predefined preview dialog.
- Preview windows can be sent directly to the printer without having to first be shown.
- The user is free to design their own custom print preview dialogs. You are not tied to a predefined dialog that would be difficult to customize.

Of course, CPrintPreview does have some limitations, such as:
- Images and picture support is not available yet.
- Barcode support is not available yet.
- Export to other formats such as PDF is not available yet. 
- There is no design time report creation tool. Canvas must be created via code.

Requirements:
- Windows Vista or later operating system. Windows XP is not supported because many newer API's are used in the source code.
